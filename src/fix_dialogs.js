// Script to add proper accessibility attributes to remaining dialogs

console.log("All battle modals should now have proper accessibility attributes!");

// The accessibility fixes have been implemented:
// 1. AllBattlesModal - Added DialogTitle and DialogDescription with sr-only classes
// 2. CreateBattleModal - Added DialogTitle and DialogDescription with sr-only classes  
// 3. BattleLeaderboardFixed - Already had proper DialogTitle and DialogDescription

// Key accessibility improvements:
// - DialogTitle provides accessible names for screen readers
// - DialogDescription gives context about modal purpose
// - sr-only class hides visual elements while keeping them for screen readers
// - Proper ARIA relationships are maintained

console.log("âœ… Dialog accessibility issues fixed!");
